[OptionExplanations]
WAIEIDifficulty=Select a difficulty.
WAIEIOptions=Adjust settings that only apply to WAIEI.

UnJoin=The player who presses the OK button will leave the game. Only available in two-player mode.
ContinueCombo=Choose the minimum judgment needed to continue the combo.
ComboColor=Choose how the combo numbers should be colored. If StepMania is selected, this changes the number color to white after breaking a combo.
BreakComboMineHit=Set whether to combo break when Mines are hit.
BreakComboHoldLetGo=Set whether to combo break when you get an N.G. on Holds and Rolls.
RollCombo=Set whether to add a combo when you hit Rolls multiple times in a row.
JudgmentsUnderField=Set whether to display judgments behind the notes.
ComboUnderField=Set whether to display the combo counter behind the notes.
CourseBannerStrictCheck=This setting determines whether the course banner image is retrieved by parsing the course file name without using the API provided by the application. If the banner is misrecognized, setting this to On will improve the situation.
FrameColor=Set the transparency of the top and bottom frames during gameplay.
FrameLight=Set whether the frame will light up in time with the song during the game. If you select Auto, the frame will start to glow from the point where the song gets exciting.
FrameOverlay=Set the frames in-game to be displayed in the foreground. This prevents the note field from being displayed in front of the frames due to staging.
ExecBrowser=Allow the QR code display screen for result sharing to open a browser directly for connection.
StartMusicTiming=Set the timing to start playing the song after it has been selected. If set to Quickly, the song will start playing during the performance and the waiting time will be shortened as much as possible.

DifficultyLabel=Set the text labels used for the difficulty labels.
DifficultyColor=Set the colors of the difficulty labels.
HighScoreType=Set whether the high score is judged by the normal score or EXScore. EXScore is recommended because it is not affected by the score calculation formula. This setting also affects other themes.
JudgmentMode=Change the text of the judgment labels.
DefaultMeterType=Select the difficulty scale to be used when not set in Group.lua/ini. This is only a guide and has no effect on the actual behavior.
DefaultLyricType=Set the default lyric display animation.
Character=Character
Stage=Set the 3D stage to be displayed in the background.
Save=Save your settings and close the Options menu.

SpeedAssist=Visualize scroll speed changes.
